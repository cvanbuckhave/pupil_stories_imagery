# Pupil size reflects moment-to-moment fluctuations in mental imagery, but not (or hardly) individual differences in imagery (Supplementary materials and data)
This repository contains the materials, data and analysis scripts for the studies 1, 2 and 3 investigating how pupil size is affected by reading, listening and imagining bright or dark stories.

Notes:
- Raw and Rdata for Study 1 are available at: https://osf.io/aymr4/
- Analysis script needs the .rds files converted to .csv, and put in a 'csvdata' folder to work properly (Study 1)
